# Today's Class!

-   Overview of the course
-   Think about your class goals
-   Plan for the rest of the semester

::: {.callout-important collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
hi

# Course goals {background-color="aquamarine"}

::: incremental
-   Learn how to think about statistics, understand data, and evaluate studies

-   Learn to separate good stats from bad

-   Learn how to use R to run analysis

-   Learn how to present data in an engaging way
:::

## Why learn R, a programming language built for statistics

::: {#whyR .incremental}
-   It is **free**

-   It can do almost *anything* you need to do

-   There is a lot of online help

-   It makes things **reproducible**
:::

## R Studio

R studio is an **integrated development** **environment** (IDE) for R that makes it easier to work with R.

It also does a lot of other things like help you \[build websites\](https://marckissel.netlify.com), create documents, and makes slides like these all with embedded stats and visualizations

# Examples

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(datasets::beaver2)
```

## you can make snazzy visualizations

```{r include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)

data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminderDataFiveYear.csv")

data_2007 <- data[which(data$year == 2007),]
data_2007 <- data_2007[order(data_2007$continent, data_2007$country),]
slope <- 2.666051223553066e-05
data_2007$size <- sqrt(data_2007$pop * slope)
colors <- c('#4AC6B7', '#1972A4', '#965F8A', '#FF7070', '#C61951')

p <- plot_ly(data_2007, x = ~gdpPercap, y = ~lifeExp, color = ~continent, size = ~size, colors = colors,
        type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', sizes = c(min(data_2007$size), max(data_2007$size)),
        marker = list(symbol = 'circle', sizemode = 'diameter',
                      line = list(width = 2, color = '#FFFFFF')),
        text = ~paste('Country:', country, '<br>Life Expectancy:', lifeExp, '<br>GDP:', gdpPercap,
                      '<br>Pop.:', pop)) %>%
  layout(title = 'Life Expectancy v. Per Capita GDP, 2007',
         xaxis = list(title = 'GDP per capita (2000 dollars)',
                      gridcolor = 'rgb(255, 255, 255)',
                      range = c(2.003297660701705, 5.191505530708712),
                      type = 'log',
                      zerolinewidth = 1,
                      ticklen = 5,
                      gridwidth = 2),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Life Expectancy (years)',
                      gridcolor = 'rgb(255, 255, 255)',
                      range = c(36.12621671352166, 91.72921793264332),
                      zerolinewidth = 1,
                      ticklen = 5,
                      gridwith = 2),
         paper_bgcolor = 'rgb(243, 243, 243)',
         plot_bgcolor = 'rgb(243, 243, 243)')


```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=9}
ggplotly(p)
```

## and informative stuff like this

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=9}
library(plotly)
library(gapminder)

p <- gapminder %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~gdpPercap, 
    y = ~lifeExp, 
    size = ~pop, 
    color = ~continent, 
    frame = ~year, 
    text = ~country, 
    hoverinfo = "text",
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers'
  ) %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(
      type = "log"
    )
  )

ggplotly(p)
```

## And interactive options....

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
viewof temp = Inputs.range([0, 100], {step: 1, value: 34, label: htl.html`Temp &#x2103;`})
```

Converting temperature from ℃ to ℉ <br>\
Celsius = \${d3.format(".0f")(temp)}℃ and Fahrenheit = \${d3.format(".1f")(temp \* 9/5 + 32)}℉.

## more

## You can do fun things in presentations:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
content <- paste(sep = "<br/>",
  "<b><a href='https://anthro.appstate.edu'>We are here</a></b>"
 
)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-81.680244, 36.214232, zoom =17) %>%  addPopups(-81.680244, 36.2142321, content,
    options = popupOptions(closeButton = TRUE)
  )

```

## Things to keep in mind: {background-color="aquamarine"}

You are going to get frustrated. Learning anything takes time and patience. And often times it isn't your fault, but the fault of the program for not making it easy to use!

# Class mechanics

1.  There is no textbook to buy for this class and all the software we will use is free. But free things come with another type of cost. I will be building the course as we go & things might be a bit wonky at times.

2.  [Lab time]{.underline}

    The only way to learn R is to practice. You should devote time in the week not just to the homework but to 'playing' with R. We will also have lab time in class where we can help each other!

# [Assessments]{.underline}

-   [Homeworks/labs]{.underline}
-   [*Stats in the news* project]{.underline}
    -   find a news story that references stats and do a deep dive into it
-   [*Data analysis*]{.underline}
    -   find/create a dataset and analyze the data
-   [weekly readings and side projects]{.underline}
    -   various in-class projects

    -   readings about the use of stats

# Course Topics

note: order might change as we work together on this

## Overview of R

### How to use/install/work with R

## Some history

## Working with data (data entry/storage)

### This will talk about best practices for recording data. We will work with Excel and other spreadsheets and talk about common problems.

## Data visualization

### How to make useful plots, graphs, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### How to explore data to get a feel for it

## Descriptive Statistics

### mean, median, SD,

## Statistical theory

### probability, hypothesis testing

## Model building

### Modern methods of testing hypotheses

## Applications

### geostats, interactive graphs

# Course stuff

-   All course materials are linked through AsULearn but please be patient with me {{< fa folder >}}

-   Do the readings before coming to class (or at the very least skim them...) {{< fa thumbs-up >}}

-   As we get better with R, we can also do all this in a different way if you want to learn more about creating and managing online resources

# next class

-   Why do we *need* stats
-   installing R
    -   please bring laptop to class. We will install programs we need and troubleshoot any troubles
-   please read [Matthews 2000 Storks Deliver Babies (P = 0.008](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=2611449))
