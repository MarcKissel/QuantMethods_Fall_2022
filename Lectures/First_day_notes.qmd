# Course goals {background-color="aquamarine"}

::: incremental
-   Learn how to think about statistics, understand data, and evaluate studies

-   Learn to separate good stats from bad

-   Learn how to use R to run analysis

-   Learn how to present data in an engaging way
:::

## Why learn R, a programming language built for statistics

::: {#whyR .incremental}
-   It is **free**

-   It can do almost *anything* you need to do

-   There is a lot of online help

-   It makes things **reproducible**
:::

## R Studio

R studio is an **integrated development** **environment** (IDE) for R that makes it easier to work with R.

It also does a lot of other things like help you \[build websites\]((https://marckissel.netlify.com), create documents, and makes slides like these all with embedded stats and visualizations

# Examples

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(datasets::beaver2)
```

## you can make snazzy visualizations

```{r include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)

data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/gapminderDataFiveYear.csv")

data_2007 <- data[which(data$year == 2007),]
data_2007 <- data_2007[order(data_2007$continent, data_2007$country),]
slope <- 2.666051223553066e-05
data_2007$size <- sqrt(data_2007$pop * slope)
colors <- c('#4AC6B7', '#1972A4', '#965F8A', '#FF7070', '#C61951')

p <- plot_ly(data_2007, x = ~gdpPercap, y = ~lifeExp, color = ~continent, size = ~size, colors = colors,
        type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', sizes = c(min(data_2007$size), max(data_2007$size)),
        marker = list(symbol = 'circle', sizemode = 'diameter',
                      line = list(width = 2, color = '#FFFFFF')),
        text = ~paste('Country:', country, '<br>Life Expectancy:', lifeExp, '<br>GDP:', gdpPercap,
                      '<br>Pop.:', pop)) %>%
  layout(title = 'Life Expectancy v. Per Capita GDP, 2007',
         xaxis = list(title = 'GDP per capita (2000 dollars)',
                      gridcolor = 'rgb(255, 255, 255)',
                      range = c(2.003297660701705, 5.191505530708712),
                      type = 'log',
                      zerolinewidth = 1,
                      ticklen = 5,
                      gridwidth = 2),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Life Expectancy (years)',
                      gridcolor = 'rgb(255, 255, 255)',
                      range = c(36.12621671352166, 91.72921793264332),
                      zerolinewidth = 1,
                      ticklen = 5,
                      gridwith = 2),
         paper_bgcolor = 'rgb(243, 243, 243)',
         plot_bgcolor = 'rgb(243, 243, 243)')


```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=9}
ggplotly(p)
```

## and informative stuff like this

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=9}
library(plotly)
library(gapminder)

p <- gapminder %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~gdpPercap, 
    y = ~lifeExp, 
    size = ~pop, 
    color = ~continent, 
    frame = ~year, 
    text = ~country, 
    hoverinfo = "text",
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers'
  ) %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(
      type = "log"
    )
  )

ggplotly(p)
```

## You can do fun things in presentations:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-81.680244, 36.214232, zoom =17)

```

## Things to keep in mind:

You are going to get frustrated. Learning anything takes time and patience. And often times it isn't your fault, but the fault of the program for not making it easy to use!

# Class mechanics

1.  There is no textbook to buy for this class and all the software we will use is free. But free things come with another type of cost. I will be building the course as we go & things might be a bit wonky at times.

2.  [Lab time]{.underline}

    The only way to learn R is to practice. You should devote time in the week not just to the homework but to 'playing' with R. We will also have lab time in class where we can help each other!

# [Assessments]{.underline}

-   Homeworks/labs
-   *Stats in the news* project
    -   find a news story that references stats and do a deep dive into it
-   Data analysis
    -   find/create a dataset and analyze the data
-   weekly readings and side projects
    -   various in-class projects

    -   readings about the use of stats

# Today's class: Why don't scientists just use common sense?

# Fermi estimations

-   Very common in job interviews

-   Questions that have to do with guessing values you won't know off hand

## What do you think of this headline?

[![](https://www.callingbullshit.org/case_studies/img/fox_fraud.png){fig-alt="Food stamps fraud at all time high?"}](https://www.callingbullshit.org/case_studies/img/fox_fraud.png)

## 

## Estimate how many Americans are on food Stamps?

> is it closer to 1% [10%]{.fragment .highlight-red} 50%

## Estimate how much the avg recipient gets

> is it closer to \$100 [\$1,000]{.fragment .highlight-red} \$10,000

## Estimate how many Americans there are

> closer to 30,000,000 [300,000,000]{.fragment .highlight-red} 3,000,000,000

## so, total expenditures on food stamp program (not counting admin etc) is about:

### [300,000,000 x .01 x \$1000 = \$30,000,000,000]{.fragment .highlight-red}

## so how much lost to fraud?

::: incremental
-   \$70,000,000 / \$30,000,000,000 = **.2% of total expenditures**

-   which is not that much lost to fraud....

-   in fact, according to Washington Post, "The cost of providing nutritional assistance to those 44 million people (on average each month) is \$70.8 billion. In other words, the amount of fraud is about 0.09 percent of all of the money spent."

# Unfair comparisons

You don't have to know anything about stats to see when things aren't being compared in a fair way

# Correlation and Causation

-   Two variables are **correlated** if knowing one value gives you info on the value of the second variable

-   The way in which they are correlated can be complex...

-   Two states are **causally related** when one state influences the other via cause-and-effect

# Averages

What is the mean class income?

## what about if this guy adds the class?

# Polling data

-   In 1936 a magazine poll of **10 million** people (2.4 million responded) predicted that [**Alf Landon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Landon){preview-link="true"} would win the Presidential election.

-   Data came from subscribers of the magazine, registered car owners, telephone list

## Problems

-   self-selection (not everyone responds)

-   people in the survey were the more wealthy ones

# Course stuff

-   All course materials are linked through AsULearn but please be patient with me

-   Do the readings before coming to class (or at the very least skim them...)

-   

    {{< fa thumbs-up >}}

    {{< fa folder >}}

-   As we get better with R, we can also do all this in a different way if you want to learn more about creating and managing online resources
