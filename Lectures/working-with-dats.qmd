# How do we record/store/view data in a way that allows us to use it in the future

-   Best advice I can give you is to think of yourself as your own co-author, looking at the data 1 year from today
-   No matter what programs you use, make it easy for you and a computer to read!

# Spreadsheets

-   Interactive computer application for organization, analysis and storage of data in tabular form. Table of cells arranged into rows and columns. A cell = box that holds data

-   Columns represented by letters, "A", "B", "C" ###- Rows represented by numbers, 1, 2, 3, \### Difference between spreadsheet and a database?

## Problems with Spreadsheets

-   Panko (2008) reported that in 13 audits of real-world spreadsheets, an average of 88% contained errors
-   In general, fine for storing data but not so great for analyzing/visualizing data
-   Almost everyone uses them, though, and hard to get around it

## Excel

-   People like to hate on Excel. Yet it is pretty standard in business and research

### Excel horror stories

-   Excel can turn gene names [into dates!](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80)

-   [Problems of dates](http://ecologybits.com/index.php/2016/07/06/beware-this-scary-thing-excel-can-do-to-your-data/)

## [So why do we use them?]{.underline}

### - Solves a lot of practical problems

### - Come preinstalled

### - Does file organization for you

### - Reactive

### - For many, it is totes fine to use. But if you do data analysis it can get annoying

# Data organization

## How can we setup data to be read by both humans *and* computers?

## How can it be setup so co-authors can understand it?

## How can we *avoid* mistakes

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### be consistent (don't switch how you name things)

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### write dates like YYYY-MM-DD

-   Excel stores dates as a number that says how many days have passed since a given date. But that *given date* isn't always the same!
-   ISO 8601

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### don't leave any cells empty

-   instead, use NA for missing data

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### put just one thing in a cell

-   for example: don't use "45 grams" but instead put the units in the column name

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Organize the data as a single rectangle

-   The first row should contain variable names
-   Avoid using more than one row for the variable names.

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### create a *data dictionary*

- A **separate** file that explains what all of the variables are.
- Don't assume something is obvious 


## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}


### Don't include calculations in the raw data files.

- Primary data file should be pristine. Make sure you can't overwrite it and do not touch it.
- Do analysis in another file

• On a Mac, right-click on the file in Finder and select "Get Info". In the menu
that opens, there is a section at the bottom on "Sharing & Permissions". Click on
"Privilege" for yourself and select "Read only".

• In Windows, right-click on the file in Windows Explorer and select "Properties". In
the "General" tab, there is a section at the bottom with "Attributes". Select the box
for "Read-only" and click the "OK" button.

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Don't use font color or highlighting as data

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Choose good names for things

- Names of columns  should make sense, have no spaces, and be consistent
- CamelCase, snake_case,

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Make backups!

- A good practice is to use the date in the file name: 2020-02-03-My_text_draft
- Or you can number them: 01_draft, 02_draft, etc.

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Use data validation to avoid data entry errors

- This controls the type of data you can enter into a cell.


## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Save the data in plain text files.

- once you are done entering data, save it as a .csv as well...this way you can easily share with others and always have access to it

## another tip: 
Get used to looking at data though a text editor, which views plain text, rather than a spreadsheet

### I tend to use Notepad, but there are [many other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors)
