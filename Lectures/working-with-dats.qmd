# How do we record/store/view data in a way that allows us to use it in the future

-   Best advice I can give you is to think of yourself as your **own co-author**, looking at the data one year from today
-   No matter what programs you use, make it easy for you and a computer to read!

# Spreadsheets

-   Interactive computer application for organization, analysis and storage of data in tabular form.

-   A cell is box that holds data. A Spreadsheet is a table of cells arranged into **rows** and **columns**.

-   Columns often represented by letters, "A", "B", "C"

-   Rows often represented by numbers, 1, 2, 3

-   Difference between spreadsheet and a database?

## 

## Problems with Spreadsheets

-   Panko (2008) reported that in 13 audits of real-world spreadsheets, an average of 88% contained errors
-   In general, fine for storing data but not so great for analyzing/visualizing data
-   Almost everyone uses them, though, and hard to get around it

## Excel

-   Excel is probably the most popular one in the US...
-   People like to hate on Excel. Yet it is pretty standard in business and research
-   Not cheap so sometimes need other programs

### Excel horror stories

-   Excel can turn gene names [into dates!](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80)

## [So why do we use Spreadsheets?]{.underline}

### - Solves a lot of practical problems

### - Come preinstalled

### - Does file organization for you

### - Reactive!

### - For many, it is totes fine to use. But if you do data analysis it can get annoying

## in-class project

Step 1: each of you take 2 plastic eggs.

step 2: in either excel, Google sheets, notebook, etc. record the information you have in each egg. You get to choose how you record and what info you record, but don't show anyone else!

Step 3: dispose of the data (i.e. either eat the candy or put it back in egg)

## Data organization tips:

#### How can we setup data to be read by both humans *and* computers?

#### How can it be setup so co-authors can understand it?

#### How can we *avoid* mistakes?

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### be consistent (don't switch how you name things)

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

#### write dates like YYYY-MM-DD

-   Excel stores dates as a number that says *how many days have passed since a given date*. But that *given date* isn't always the same!
-   **1900 vs. 1904**
-   ISO 8601
    -   Date and time values are ordered from the largest to smallest unit of time

    -   four-digit year \[YYYY\], two-digit month of the year (01 through 12), and a two-digit day of that month (01 through 31)

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### don't leave any cells empty

-   instead, use NA for missing data

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### put just one thing in a cell

-   for example: don't use "45 grams" but instead put the units in the column name

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Organize the data as a single rectangle

-   The first row should contain variable names

    ::: callout-important
    Avoid using *more than one row* for the variable names.
    :::

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### create a *data dictionary*

-   A **separate** file that explains what all of the variables are.
-   Don't assume something is obvious

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Don't include calculations in the raw data files.

-   Primary data file should be pristine. Make sure you can't overwrite it and do not touch it.
-   Do analysis in another file

## 

• On a Mac, right-click on the file in Finder and select "Get Info". In the menu that opens, there is a section at the bottom on "Sharing & Permissions". Click on "Privilege" for yourself and select "Read only".

• In Windows, right-click on the file in Windows Explorer and select "Properties". In the "General" tab, there is a section at the bottom with "Attributes". Select the box for "Read-only" and click the "OK" button.

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Don't use [font color]{style="color:#cc0000"} or [highlighting]{style="background: yellow;"} as data

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Choose good names for things

-   Names of columns should make sense, have no spaces, and be consistent
    -   CamelCase, snake_case,

| Good             | Alternative       | Avoid             |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Observation_01   | first_observation | 1st Obs           |
| Max_temp_C       | MaxTemp           | Maximum Temp (°C) |
| Precipitation_mm | Precipitation     | precmm            |

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Make backups!

-   A good practice is to use the date in the file name: 2020-02-03-My_text_draft
-   Or you can number them: 01_draft, 02_draft, etc.

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Use data validation to avoid data entry errors

-   This controls the type of data you can enter into a cell.

## [Data organization in spreadsheets]{.underline}

### Save the data in plain text files.

-   once you are done entering data, save it as a .csv as well...this way you can easily share with others and always have access to it

## another tip:

Get used to looking at data though a text editor, which views plain text, rather than a spreadsheet

### I tend to use Notepad, but there are [many other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors)

# For Thursday

-   finish lab
-   bring in a news story (see handout from last week or AsULearn)

# part 2 of class

How did you do with the spreadsheet lab

## news article

My example

[Scientists find out the best way to soothe a crying baby](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/sep/13/scientists-find-out-the-best-way-to-soothe-a-crying-baby)

[the scientific article](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(22)01363-X.pdf)

## ok, but what does spreadsheet management look like in real life?

I'm going to show you an example of this, and then y'all will try to do it on your own (following handout) and see how it goes...
