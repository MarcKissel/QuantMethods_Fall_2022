# Today's class: Why don't scientists just use common sense?

# Fermi estimations

-   Very common in job interviews

-   Questions that have to do with guessing values you won't know off hand

## What do you think of this headline?

## 

## Estimate how many Americans are on food Stamps?

> is it closer to 1% [10%]{.fragment .highlight-red} 50%

## Estimate how much the avg recipient gets

> is it closer to \$100 [\$1,000]{.fragment .highlight-red} \$10,000

## Estimate how many Americans there are

> closer to 30,000,000 [300,000,000]{.fragment .highlight-red} 3,000,000,000

## so, total expenditures on food stamp program (not counting admin etc) is about:

### [300,000,000 x .01 x \$1000 = \$30,000,000,000]{.fragment .highlight-red}

## so how much lost to fraud?

::: incremental
-   \$70,000,000 / \$30,000,000,000 = **.2% of total expenditures**

-   which is not that much lost to fraud....

-   in fact, according to Washington Post, "The cost of providing nutritional assistance to those 44 million people (on average each month) is \$70.8 billion. In other words, the amount of fraud is about 0.09 percent of all of the money spent."

# Unfair comparisons

You don't have to know anything about stats to see when things aren't being compared in a fair way

# Correlation and Causation

-   Two variables are **correlated** if knowing one value gives you info on the value of the second variable

-   The way in which they are correlated can be complex...

-   Two states are **causally related** when one state influences the other via cause-and-effect

# Averages

What is the mean class income?

## what about if this guy adds the class?

# Polling data

-   In 1936 a magazine poll of **10 million** people (2.4 million responded) predicted that [**Alf Landon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Landon){preview-link="true"} would win the Presidential election.

-   Data came from subscribers of the magazine, registered car owners, telephone list

## Problems

-   self-selection (not everyone responds)

-   people in the survey were the more wealthy ones
