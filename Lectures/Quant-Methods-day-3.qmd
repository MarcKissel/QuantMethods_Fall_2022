# Data science

definition by Hilary Mason and Chris H. Wiggins

https://sites.google.com/a/isim.net.in/datascience_isim/taxonomy

define data science according to the following five steps: (1) obtaining data, (2) scrubbing data, (3) exploring data, (4) modeling data, and (5) interpreting data. Together, these steps form the OSEMN model (which is pronounced as awesome).
